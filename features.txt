Actions:
  Jump / Fast Fall [A]:
    If player is grounded:
      Sets player horizontal speed to 0
    Else, if player is midair and has a double jump:
      Player gains small vertical boost while maintaining momentum
      If jumped immediately after hitting an enemy with a dash, jumps forward with dash speed
      Else, jumps forward with regular horizontal speed
    Else, the player is mid-air with no doublejump, so
      Set vertical speed to maximum falling speed
      Creates a hitbox
      If the player hits an enemy while fast falling, the enemy is destroyed and the player receives a small vertical boost
  Dash [X]:
    Can only be used if the player is grounded or has air dash
    Increases player horizontal speed
    Creates the hitbox
    Sets player vertical speed to 0

Both the player's double jump and the player's air dash are refreshed upon touching the ground or
hitting an enemy with a hitbox, and each can only be used once until refreshed again
